                <p class="para">     I’m Cherry Kim, a computer science student from Myanmar 
                    and a proud member of the Falam community. I’m currently a 
                    senior at the University of Indianapolis, graduating in May 2026 
                    with a Bachelor’s in Computer Science. My journey into technology 
                    began in high school, when an introductory CS course sparked 
                    my passion for problem-solving and innovation. From there, I began 
                    to wonder just how far technology could go and how I might one day 
                    contribute to it. That curiosity kept pushing me to explore new concepts, 
                    experiment with small projects, and see computer science not just as 
                    a subject,but as a way of thinking about the world.<br><br>

                        Created a strong academic support system for students by assisting 
                        with computer science courses, helping break down complex topics 
                        such as algorithms, data structures, and programming principles. 
                        Regularly guided students through lab assignments, provided 
                        constructive feedback, and encouraged problem-solving strategies 
                        that improved their confidence and performance. This role deepened 
                        my own mastery of computer science while sharpening my

                <p>Created a program that was developed as part of a team 
                    project exploring the application of data 
                    structures and algorithms in real-world contexts. 
                    Our goal was to simulate a class grading system that
                    could dynamically handle student data. I implemented
                    features to securely access private variables and 
                    modify student information, ensuring flexibility
                    while maintaining encapsulation. This project helped
                    me appreciate how foundational computer science concepts
                    can translate directly into practical systems for data
                    management.

                    of monitoring approaches and sensing modalities, 
                    defined objectives and constraints, and used Six Sigma
